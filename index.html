      <h2 class="aricle-title">Trump Election Claims.</h2>
    <img class="img-DeeTee" src="resorses\images\Donald_Trump.jpeg" alt="Picture of Donald Trump">
  <p class="election2020">A team of Associated Press reporters spent months reviewing every possible voter fraud case
in six battleground states disputed by former President Donald Trump, and they found "fewer than 475 — a number that
would have made no difference in the 2020 presidential election," AP reports. 
<b>The disputed ballots identified in more than 300 local election offices amounted to just 0.15 percent of President Biden's
margin of victory in the six states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
"The cases could not throw the outcome into question even if all the potentially fraudulent votes were for Biden,
which they were not, and even if those ballots were actually counted, which in most cases they were not," AP reports.
"The cases are bipartisan. Some of those charged with fraud are registered Republicans or told investigators they 
were supporters of Trump." In fact, every specific case written up in the AP report involved a Trump supporter voting 
twice or casing a ballot illegally.</b>
Three apparent Trump supporters were recently arrested in Florida and charged with casting more than one vote, 
The Washington Post reports. The three residents of The Villages are charged with having voted in Florida
and also another state — Michigan, New York, and an undisclosed state, the Post says, and they were arrested after
the county elections supervisor ordered an investigation.
All these cases "underscore that suspected fraud is both generally detected and exceptionally rare," AP reports, 
but "Trump's false claims of a stolen election fueled the deadly Jan. 6 attempted insurrection at the Capitol, 
have led to death threats against election officials, and have become deeply ingrained within the GOP, 
with two-thirds of Republicans believing Biden's election is illegitimate."</p>

  <h2 class="trade-deal">Donald Trump's huge trade deal with China</h2>
  <img class="dotrump-xi" src="resorses\images\AATW8ao.jpeg">
  <p>The final tally is in, and the numbers are grim: Donald Trump's huge trade deal with China — the deal he trumpeted as a
  "transformative" victory for the U.S. — turned out to be a massive bust.
  The deal, it may be remembered, required China to make <b>$200 billion</b> in new purchases of agricultural and manufactured
  goods, services and crude oil and other energy.
  The idea floated by Trump was that the deal would end the trade war he had started with China, while producing a massive
  infusion of new income for American manufacturers and growers.
  Today the only undisputed 'historical' aspect of that agreement is its failure.

  None of those outcomes happened.<br> Although the trade war stopped escalating, most of the tariffs Trump had imposed on
  Chinese goods remained in place, as did retaliatory tariffs China imposed.
  More to the point, "China bought none of the additional $200 billion of exports Trump's deal had promised."
  That's the finding of a study just published by Chad P. Bown of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, who
  has assiduously tracked China trade since the deal was reached.
  Trump called the deal a "historical" agreement — and even bragged that China would buy not $200 billion in new goods and
  services but $300 billion. As Bown writes, however: "Today the only undisputed 'historical' aspect of that agreement is
  its failure."
  In the end, Bown calculates,<b> China bought only 57% of all the exported goods and services it had committed to purchase
  under the deal, "not even enough to reach its import levels from before the trade war."</b>
